# Portable FOAASClient for .NET

Were you looking to leverage the cloud to tell someone to fuck themselves? Do you need to do it from .NET? Well fuck me! Look no further!

This **portable** library automates calls to [FOAAS](http://foaas) (which is probably the best web service ever). I make no claims of ownership of FOAAS or to it's availability. What the fuck do you want from me?
